Build a fully functional bilingual (Arabic first, English available) browser-based 3D game demo.

Constraints:
- Must run fully offline with no external services.
- Do not hotlink images. Include any textures/posters/screenshots locally under public/images/.
- Persist settings and high scores in browser storage.

Game concept (keep it simple but polished):
- A third-person 3D maze or arena where the player collects items before time runs out.
- Keyboard controls (WASD/arrow keys) + optional mouse look; include an on-screen help overlay.
- At least 3 levels with increasing difficulty, driven by seeded local level data.
- Collectibles, a timer, scoring, and a win/lose screen.
- Pause menu with settings (language, sound on/off, sensitivity, reset progress).
- High scores leaderboard (local only).

Pages:
- Title screen with Play, How to Play, Settings.
- Game screen.
- High Scores screen.
- Help page with "Reset demo data".

Localization:
- Arabic-first UI with good English translations; default Arabic; RTL/LTR switching where applicable.

UX quality:
- Smooth animations, clear HUD, and graceful handling if 3D rendering is not supported (show a friendly message).
