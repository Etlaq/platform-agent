Build a fully functional bilingual (Arabic first, English available) beauty and skincare ecommerce store demo.

Constraints:
- No external services/APIs.
- Do not hotlink images. Include all product images locally under public/images/.
- Persist skin profile, routine builder, cart, and wishlist in browser storage.

Features:
- Home: featured routines (morning/night), new launches, and best sellers.
- Skin profile quiz (demo): skin type, concerns, sensitivities; results stored locally.
- Product listing: search, filters (skin concern, skin type, ingredient-free options, price, rating), sort.
- Product details: ingredient list, usage instructions, safety notes (demo), and "fits your profile" highlights.
- Routine builder: build a morning and night routine by selecting products; validate order (cleanser -> treatment -> moisturizer -> SPF).
- Wishlist + cart + checkout: full demo flow with order confirmation and order history.

Content and localization:
- Seed at least 28 products across categories (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, masks) with Arabic-first copy + good English translations.
- Provide local imagery for products and routine cards.
- Default language Arabic; layout switches RTL/LTR.

UX quality:
- Friendly guidance and warnings (e.g., avoid mixing certain actives in the same routine, demo logic is fine).
- Help page + "Reset demo data" button.
