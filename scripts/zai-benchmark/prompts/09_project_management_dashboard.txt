Build a fully functional bilingual (Arabic first, English available) project management dashboard demo.

Constraints:
- No external services/APIs.
- Persist all data in browser storage (projects, boards, tasks, settings).

Features:
- Projects: list/create/edit/archive projects; each project has members (demo) and boards.
- Kanban board: columns, drag-and-drop tasks, task details drawer, labels, due dates, priorities, and assignees (demo).
- Views: Board view + List view + Calendar view (demo calendar is fine).
- Search: global search across tasks with filters (status, label, assignee, due date).
- Activity log: show local activity events (created task, moved column, changed priority).
- Settings/help: language toggle, and "Reset demo data".

Content and localization:
- Seed 3 projects with realistic tasks (at least 40 tasks total) and Arabic-first copy + good English translations.
- Default Arabic; RTL/LTR switching.

UX quality:
- Clean navigation, empty states, and helpful validations.
