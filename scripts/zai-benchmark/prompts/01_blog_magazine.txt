Build a complete bilingual (Arabic first, English available) blog + magazine website.

Constraints:
- Fully functional as a standalone demo with no external services or APIs.
- Do not hotlink images. Include all images locally under public/images/ and reference them from the UI.
- Persist user-generated data (comments, bookmarks, admin-created posts) in browser storage.

Pages and features:
- Home: featured story, trending list, topic sections, editor picks, and a newsletter signup (demo).
- Explore/Posts: search, category filter, tag filter, sort (newest, most read, editor picks), and pagination or infinite load.
- Post details: cover image, author card, reading time, table of contents, related posts, and "copy link" share action.
- Comments: add/edit/delete your own comments, report a comment (local only), collapse long threads.
- Bookmarks: bookmark posts, view and manage bookmarks in a Reading List page.
- Authors: author profile pages with bio and all posts by that author.
- Admin demo: a simple post editor to create a new post (title, excerpt, category, tags, body, cover image chosen from local images). New posts must appear immediately in lists.
- Help/Settings: language toggle, and a "Reset demo data" button.

Content and localization:
- Seed at least 12 posts across 4 categories and 10 tags, with realistic Arabic-first content and high-quality English translations.
- Default language is Arabic; layout should switch RTL/LTR based on language.
- Seed author avatars and post cover images as local files.

UX quality:
- Clear navigation and footer.
- Empty states, loading states, and friendly error messages.
