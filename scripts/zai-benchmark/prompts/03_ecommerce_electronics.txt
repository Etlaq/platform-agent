Build a fully functional bilingual (Arabic first, English available) electronics ecommerce store demo.

Constraints:
- No external services/APIs. Everything works with seeded local data.
- Do not hotlink images. Include product images locally under public/images/.
- Persist compare list, cart, and orders in browser storage.

Core features:
- Home: featured deals, categories, and "compare top picks" section.
- Category browsing: phones, laptops, headphones, smart home, accessories (at least 5 categories).
- Search: fast search with suggestions (demo), and recent searches.
- Filters: price range, brand, rating, availability, and key specs per category (e.g., RAM/storage for laptops).
- Product page: spec table, highlight chips, warranty info (demo), reviews (seeded), and Q&A (local, stored).
- Compare: compare up to 4 products side-by-side with spec differences highlighted.
- Cart + checkout: complete flow (demo payments), order confirmation, and order history with statuses.

Content and localization:
- Seed at least 30 products with realistic specs (RAM, storage, battery, display, etc.) and local images.
- All UI text and product copy must be Arabic-first with good English translations.
- Default language Arabic; layout switches RTL/LTR with language.

UX quality:
- Great empty states (no results, empty compare, empty cart).
- A "Reset demo data" option in settings/help.
